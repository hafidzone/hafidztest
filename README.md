Present: A Future Built on Love
===


This codebase handles two things
1. Corporate website
2. Single page webapp for viewing single presents

1. Corporate website
---
All the views for the website are under ./views/web. Views are not inherited code. So, there's no layout file.
Other than being in jade, there isn't anything much there.

All the related libraries are stored in following folders -
1. ./public/stylesheets
2. ./public/javascripts


2. Single page webapp for viewing single presents
---
All the views for the app are under ./views.

layout.jade is the main layout file
single.jade is the container view for showing present
