          | you must provide access credentials either in the form of an email address and
          | password or by authentication using another service, such as Facebook. You may
          | optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a short
          | bio, location, and profile picture. If you create your Present account by
          | connecting through another service, we may use public information from that
          | connected account to help complete your Present profile. You may update or
          | modify your profile information and contact information at any time. Profile
          | information is available publicly on our Services, such as on your profile
          | page.

        span(style='font-family: Calibri; color: #262626;')
          | Our Services include several
          | features to help you find the accounts of people you already know. For example,
          | you may upload information from your address book or connect your Present
          | account to your account on another service such as Facebook. Present will match
          | the information you provide with the contact information of other Present
          | users. We do not retain your address book information after displaying these
          | matches. When you connect your Present account to other services, you are able
          | to post your Content to those services as well. You may disconnect your Present
          | account from your account on the other services at any time. Disconnecting your
          | Present account will immediately revoke our authorization to cross-post on your
          | behalf or otherwise access that account and we will delete information obtained
          | from that connection (other than information that was publicly posted on Present,
          | such as profile information), which may take some time.

        span(style='font-family: Calibri; color: #262626;')
          | Present is a video sharing platform,
          | so most of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be
          | made public. This includes not only the Content that you post and data provided
          | with such Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you
          | follow, the Content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions
          | on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated.
          | For instance, your profile information and public Content are immediately
          | delivered to a wide range of users and other services that access Present. When
          | you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully
          | about what you are making public.

          | In addition to profile information, you may also tell

          | to send us location information. We may use and store information about your
          | location to provide features of our Services, such as tagging a video with a
          | location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with Content
          | that has been tagged near your location.

          | usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize
          | and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.
          | If you do not want cookies from Present or other websites, you can instruct
          | your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt
          | you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some

          | terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our

          | videos hosted by Present, or interact with our email notifications. Present
          | uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve
